# topological-sorting-and-BFS

**Recursive algorithms** for **topological search** and **breadth-first-search** (BFS) in java. The program interprets directed acyclic graphs from .txt files that it recieves as input. These files have the format of the first line containing the number of nodes and links, and the following lines defining what nodes a directional link goes from and to, seperated by space. Example files can be found in this repository. As part of the algorithm for topological search a modified **depth-first-search** (DFS) algorithm is used.
